## Creating environment
### Creating on Linux systems
Installing dependencies for Linux operating systems
```
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

Environment creation
```
python3 -m venv ./python_code_recipes_venv
source ./python_code_recipes_venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Creating on Windows systems
```
"%LocalAppData%\Programs\Python\Python38\python.exe" -m venv MY_APP_ENV
\MY_APP_ENV\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Activation of environment in Windows 10.
```
cd ./python_code_recipes_venv/Scripts
activate
```

### Managing Python environments
To check Python version installed.
```
python --version
```

To freeze libraries in virtual environment
```
pip freeze
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
